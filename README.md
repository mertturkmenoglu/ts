# TypeScript
***
* This repository contains TypeScript examples.
* I learn TypeScript as a side language. I mostly use C or Java. TypeScript is quite new for me. I am sure that there are many ways to make the code better but again, I am a learner and all helps are welcome. 
# Coding
* You need a **text editor** or an **IDE** to write or see the code. (I prefer Visual Studio Code)
* You need **TypeScript compiler**. Best source for download: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
# Contributing
* All ideas and helps are welcome. Please contact with me.
